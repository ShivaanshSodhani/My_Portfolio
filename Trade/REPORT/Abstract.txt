This study employs cluster analysis to explore the dynamic relationships between trade volume, GDP, and economic classifications of countries over the period 2000 to 2021. By examining how countries are grouped based on economic indicators and how these groupings evolve in response to major global economic events, the research aims to uncover patterns and implications of economic resilience and vulnerability. Utilizing data-driven methodologies, including K-Means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models, alongside validation through the silhouette score, we analyzed shifts in economic clusters during key crises such as the 9/11 attacks, the 2008 financial crisis, the European debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings reveal significant changes in cluster memberships correlating with these events, highlighting the impact of global crises on national economies. The study offers insights into the complex interplay of trade and GDP changes, providing a nuanced understanding of global economic dynamics and aiding in the formulation of more informed economic policies and strategies.
